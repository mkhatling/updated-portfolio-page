# Professional Portfolio

This is a page that I designed which is intended to showcase some things I've been working on. Take a look and you'll find my first group project from boot camp. It's a movie recommendation app which gives users suggestions on which movies to watch if they can't decide. Another project was a homework from bootcamp that is a random password generator. 

You can see more about these projects and others at the deployed page with is here: https://mkhatling.github.io/updated-portfolio-page/
